##Task

Given n lines of credit card numbers, mask the first digits of each credit card
number with an asterisk (i.e., *) and print the masked card number on a new line.
Each credit card number consists of four space-separated groups of four digits.
For example, the credit card number 1234 5678 9101 1234 would be masked and 
printed as **** **** **** 1234.

# [Matrix Layer Rotation](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/matrix-rotation-algo/problem)

You are given a 2D matrix of dimension and a positive integer . You have to
rotate the matrix times and print the resultant matrix. Rotation should be
in anti-clockwise direction.

Rotation of a

matrix is represented by the following figure. Note that in one rotation,
you have to shift elements by one step only.

matrix-rotation

It is guaranteed that the minimum of m and n will be even.

As an example rotate the Start matrix by 2:

    Start         First           Second
     1 2 3 4       2  3  4  5      3  4  5  6
    12 1 2 5  ->   1  2  3  6 ->   2  3  4  7
    11 4 3 6      12  1  4  7      1  2  1  8
    10 9 8 7      11 10  9  8     12 11 10  9

Function Description

Complete the matrixRotation function in the editor below.

matrixRotation has the following parameter(s):

    int matrix[m][n]: a 2D array of integers
    int r: the rotation factor

Prints
It should print the resultant 2D integer array and return nothing. Print
each row on a separate line as space-separated integers.

Input Format

The first line contains three space separated integers,
, , and , the number of rows and columns in , and the required rotation.
The next lines contain space-separated integers representing the elements
of a row of .
